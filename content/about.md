Hello guys! My name is Marcos Ferreira and I am a Systems Information student at UNESA. Currently, I am a backend developer at Grupo GFT and I am excited to develop my skills as a backend developer.

I have a solid foundation in various technologies and approaches, which allows me to tackle any challenge that arises. I have worked with languages such as C#, Java, and frameworks such as SpringBoot, .NET Framework, and .NET Core. I am proficient in using tools such as Docker, RabbitMQ, and I have knowledge of architecture patterns such as CQRS, MVC, and Microservices.

Although my main focus is on backend, I also have experience with front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwinds. I also have skills in unit testing with XUnit and JUnit.

My database knowledge includes SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I have experience working in cloud environments such as Azure.

If you want to know more about me and my projects, check out my Github at https://github.com/MarcosFerreira17 and my personal website at https://marcosferreira.vercel.app.
