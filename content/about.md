Hello guys! my name is Marcos. Iâ€™m 25 years old, and passionate about: software development,
sharing knowledge, and communities. I have over 3 years of experience working with software development in large, highly critical environments such as B3 Insurance and Western Union.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects that have provided me with a deep understanding of building robust and scalable applications that meet specific client requirements.

I have a strong background in backend development using C#, Java and frameworks like .NET Framework, and .NET Core, Spring Boot. I also have experience with tools such as Docker and RabbitMQ, which streamline deployment and enable seamless communication between system components.

In addition to backend development, I have a solid foundation in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with popular frameworks like React, allowing me to create modern and responsive user interfaces.

I have expertise in unit testing using XUnit and JUnit, ensuring the quality and reliability of the code I develop. Additionally, I have skills in working with databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.
