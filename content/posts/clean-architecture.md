Clean Architecture is a software design approach that aims to create highly scalable, testable, and sustainable systems by focusing on separating responsibilities and building independent layers. With the arrival of .NET 6, we now have a modern and powerful platform that allows us to easily and efficiently implement this approach.

**What is Clean Architecture?**

Clean Architecture is a software design approach that aims to create highly scalable, testable, and sustainable systems by focusing on separating responsibilities and building independent layers. With the arrival of .NET 6, we now have a modern and powerful platform that allows us to easily and efficiently implement this approach.

The main concept behind Clean Architecture is the idea of separating concepts into distinct and independent layers. These layers are defined based on the responsibility of the code they contain and are organized into a set of concentric rings.

At the center of the system, we have the domain layer, which contains the entities and business rules. Next, we have the application layer, which contains the use cases and orchestrates the interactions between the entities of the domain. Then, we have the infrastructure layer, which provides support to the system, such as access to the database, external APIs, etc. Finally, we have the user interface layer, which is responsible for presenting information to the user.

## **Implementing Clean Architecture with C# .NET 6**

With .NET 6, we have a modern and powerful platform that allows us to implement Clean Architecture with ease and efficiency. In the following sections, we will see how to implement each layer of the architecture.

### **Domain Layer**

The domain layer is where entities and business rules are defined. This layer is independent of the other layers of the system and should not depend on any specific technology. In C# .NET 6, we can create this layer in a separate class library. In this library, we can define domain entities as well as repository interfaces for data access. We can also define application use cases, which represent high-level actions that the user can perform.

### **Application Layer**

The application layer is responsible for orchestrating the interactions between the entities of the domain. In this layer, we define service interfaces that represent the use cases of the application. This layer is implemented in a separate class library. In this library, we can define service interfaces, which are implemented by the use case classes. These classes are responsible for orchestrating the interactions between the domain entities and implementing the business logic of the application.

### **Infrastructure Layer**

The infrastructure layer is responsible for providing support to the system, such as access to the database, external APIs, etc. In this layer, we define the implementation classes for the repository and service interfaces defined in the previous layers. In C# .NET 6, we can implement this layer in a separate class library. In this library, we can define implementation classes for the repository and service interfaces defined in the previous layers. Additionally, we can define database contexts and application configurations.

### **User Interface layer**

The user interface layer is responsible for presenting the information to the user. In this layer, we define graphical user interfaces (GUI) and service APIs.

In C# .NET 6, we can implement this layer in a web or mobile application project. In this project, we can define the GUIs and service APIs, which interact with the previous layers through the defined interfaces.

## **Benefits of the Clean Architecture**

The Clean Architecture brings many benefits to software development. Among them, we can highlight:

- **Ease of Maintenance**: the separation of responsibilities and the construction of independent layers make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Scalability**: Separating concepts into distinct and independent layers allows the system to be easily scalable.
- Testability**: separating responsibilities makes the code easier to test.
- **Sustainability**: building a system that is highly scalable, testable and easy to maintain ensures the sustainability of the system over time.

## **Conclusion**

Clean Architecture is a software design approach that aims to create highly scalable, testable, and sustainable systems by focusing on separating responsibilities and building independent layers. With .NET 6, we now have a modern and powerful platform that allows us to implement this approach easily and efficiently.

By implementing Clean Architecture in C# .NET 6, we can create highly scalable, testable, and sustainable systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and evolve over time. In addition, separating responsibilities and building independent layers makes the code easier to test and ensures the sustainability of the system.
