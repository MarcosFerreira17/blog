### Single Responsability

Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.

### Open/Closed

Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.

In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

### Liskov Substitution

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

### Interface Segregation

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they canâ€™t do

Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

### Dependency Inversion

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
