Welcome to my blog dedicated to software engineering! My name is Marcos Ferreira, and I'm a Systems Information student at UNESA, currently working as a backend developer at Grupo GFT. On this website, you'll find a wealth of tips, tutorials, and articles to help you stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in software development.

As a passionate developer with a solid foundation in various technologies and approaches, I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge. I have experience working with languages such as C#, Java, and frameworks like SpringBoot, .NET Framework, and .NET Core. I'm proficient in tools such as Docker, RabbitMQ, and have knowledge of architecture patterns like CQRS, MVC, and Microservices.

Although my main focus is backend development, I'm also skilled in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwinds. Additionally, I have experience in unit testing with XUnit and JUnit.

My expertise in databases includes SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I'm well-versed in working in cloud environments like Azure.

Join me on this journey of learning and discovery in the ever-evolving world of software development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, there's always something new to learn.
